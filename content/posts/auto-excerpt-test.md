# Introduction to Auto Excerpts

This post demonstrates the new automatic excerpt generation feature in KPGB. The excerpt should be generated from the first paragraph of the content, stripping markdown formatting while preserving readability.

## How It Works

The system now automatically generates excerpts when:

1. No excerpt is provided in the frontmatter
2. The content needs to be summarized for list views
3. Clean, readable text is needed without HTML

### Technical Details

The excerpt generator uses **pulldown-cmark** to parse markdown and extract plain text. It handles:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists and nested structures
- Code blocks (which are excluded from excerpts)
- Links and other formatting

```rust
// This code block won't appear in the excerpt
fn generate_excerpt(markdown: &str) -> String {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

## Benefits

The automatic excerpt generation provides several benefits:

- Consistent formatting across all posts
- Better readability in list views
- Reduced manual work for authors
- SEO-friendly summaries

This feature enhances the overall user experience by providing clear, concise previews of each post without requiring authors to manually write excerpts.
